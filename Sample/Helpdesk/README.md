# Pragmatic Event Sourcing With Marten
- Simplest CQRS and Event Sourcing flow using Minimal API,
- Cutting the number of layers to bare minimum,
- Using all Marten helpers like `WriteToAggregate`, `AggregateStream` to simplify the processing,
- Examples of all the typical Marten's projections,
- example of how and where to use C# Records, Nullable Reference Types, etc,
- No Aggregates! Commands are handled in the domain service as pure functions.
